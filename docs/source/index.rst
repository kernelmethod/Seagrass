Seagrass documentation
====================================

Welcome to the documentation for Seagrass!

Seagrass is a Python library for auditing user-defined events in your code. You
can use it to emit a log whenever a function is called, profile small sections
of code, monitor what files get opened, and much, much more.

To get started, check out the :ref:`quick-start-guide`. Otherwise, you can
browse the table of contents for the information you're looking for.
